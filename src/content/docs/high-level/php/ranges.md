Ranges in PHP allow you to specify a sequence of values in a concise and efficient way. They are commonly used in loops, array generation, and other scenarios where you need to work with a consecutive set of values.

To create a range in PHP, you can use the `range()` function. It takes three arguments: the starting value, the ending value, and an optional step value. The function returns an array containing all the values in the specified range.

Here's an example of creating a range of numbers from 1 to 10:

```php
$numbers = range(1, 10);
print_r($numbers);
```

Output:
```
Array
(
  [0] => 1
  [1] => 2
  [2] => 3
  [3] => 4
  [4] => 5
  [5] => 6
  [6] => 7
  [7] => 8
  [8] => 9
