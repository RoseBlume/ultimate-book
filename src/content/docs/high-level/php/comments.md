In PHP, comments are used to add explanatory notes or to temporarily disable certain code segments. There are two types of comments in PHP: single-line comments and multi-line comments.

Single-line comments start with two forward slashes (`//`) and continue until the end of the line. They are commonly used to provide brief explanations or to comment out a single line of code.

```php
// This is a single-line comment in PHP
```

Multi-line comments, also known as block comments, start with `/*` and end with `*/`. They can span multiple lines and are often used for longer explanations or for commenting out multiple lines of code.

```php
/*
This is a multi-line comment
in PHP. It can span multiple lines
and is enclosed between /* and */.
*/
```

Comments are ignored by the PHP interpreter and do not affect the execution of the code. They are useful for documenting your code, making it more readable, and for leaving notes for yourself or other developers.

Remember to use comments sparingly and to keep them up-to-date as your code evolves.
