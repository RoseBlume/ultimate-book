In PHP, the `break` and `continue` statements are used to control the flow of loops.

### The `break` statement

The `break` statement is used to exit a loop prematurely. It is commonly used with the `while`, `do-while`, `for`, and `switch` statements.

Here's an example of using `break` in a `while` loop:

```php
$i = 0;
while ($i < 10) {
  if ($i === 5) {
    break;
  }
  echo $i;
  $i++;
}
```

In the above example, the loop will terminate when the value of `$i` becomes 5.

### The `continue` statement

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of a loop. It is also commonly used with the `while`, `do-while`, `for`, and `foreach` statements.

Here's an example of using `continue` in a `for` loop:

```php
for ($i = 0; $i < 10; $i++) {
  if ($i % 2 === 0) {
    continue;
  }
  echo $i;
}
```

In the above example, the loop will skip even numbers and only print odd numbers.

Both `break` and `continue` statements are powerful tools for controlling the flow of loops in PHP.
