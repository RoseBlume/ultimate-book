Inheritance in PHP allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class. This promotes code reusability and allows for the creation of more specialized classes based on existing ones.

To create a class that inherits from another class, we use the `extends` keyword. For example:

```php
class Animal {
  protected $name;

  public function __construct($name) {
    $this->name = $name;
  }

  public function eat() {
    echo $this->name . " is eating.";
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  public function bark() {
    echo $this->name . " is barking.";
  }
}
```

In the example above, the `Dog` class extends the `Animal` class. This means that the `Dog` class inherits the `name` property and the `eat()` method from the `Animal` class. Additionally, the `Dog` class defines its own `bark()` method.

To create an instance of the `Dog` class and call its methods, we can do the following:

```php
$dog = new Dog("Buddy");
$dog->eat(); // Output: Buddy is eating.
$dog->bark(); // Output: Buddy is barking.
```

In this example, we create a new instance of the `Dog` class with the name "Buddy". We then call the `eat()` and `bark()` methods, which are inherited from the `Animal` class and defined in the `Dog` class, respectively.

This is a basic example of inheritance in PHP. Inheritance allows for the creation of more specialized classes by reusing code from existing classes, making our code more modular and maintainable.
