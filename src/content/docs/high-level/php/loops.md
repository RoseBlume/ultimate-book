## Loops in PHP

In PHP, loops are used to repeatedly execute a block of code until a certain condition is met. There are several types of loops available in PHP:

### 1. `for` loop

The `for` loop is used when you know the number of times you want to execute a block of code. It consists of three parts: initialization, condition, and increment/decrement.

```php
for ($i = 0; $i < 5; $i++) {
  // code to be executed
}
```

### 2. `while` loop

The `while` loop is used when you want to execute a block of code as long as a certain condition is true.

```php
$i = 0;
while ($i < 5) {
  // code to be executed
  $i++;
}
```

### 3. `do-while` loop

The `do-while` loop is similar to the `while` loop, but the condition is checked after executing the block of code. This means that the block of code will always be executed at least once.

```php
$i = 0;
do {
  // code to be executed
  $i++;
} while ($i < 5);
```

### 4. `foreach` loop

The `foreach` loop is used to iterate over arrays or objects. It automatically assigns the current value of the array or object to a variable.

```php
$fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];
foreach ($fruits as $fruit) {
  // code to be executed
  echo $fruit;
}
```

These are the basic loop structures in PHP. They allow you to efficiently repeat code and perform repetitive tasks. Choose the appropriate loop based on your specific requirements.
