## Arithmetic Operators

In PHP, arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations on variables or values. Here are some commonly used arithmetic operators:

- Addition: `+`
- Subtraction: `-`
- Multiplication: `*`
- Division: `/`
- Modulus: `%`
- Exponentiation: `**`

Example:

```php
$a = 10;
$b = 5;

// Addition
$result = $a + $b;
echo "Addition: " . $result . "<br>";

// Subtraction
$result = $a - $b;
echo "Subtraction: " . $result . "<br>";

// Multiplication
$result = $a * $b;
echo "Multiplication: " . $result . "<br>";

// Division
$result = $a / $b;
echo "Division: " . $result . "<br>";

// Modulus
$result = $a % $b;
echo "Modulus: " . $result . "<br>";

// Exponentiation
$result = $a ** $b;
echo "Exponentiation: " . $result . "<br>";
```

## Comparison Operators

Comparison operators are used to compare two values in PHP. They return either `true` or `false` based on the comparison result. Here are some commonly used comparison operators:

- Equal to: `==`
- Not equal to: `!=`
- Identical to: `===`
- Not identical to: `!==`
- Greater than: `>`
- Less than: `<`
- Greater than or equal to: `>=`
- Less than or equal to: `<=`

Example:

```php
$a = 10;
$b = 5;

// Equal to
$result = $a == $b;
echo "Equal to: " . var_export($result, true) . "<br>";

// Not equal to
$result = $a != $b;
echo "Not equal to: " . var_export($result, true) . "<br>";

// Identical to
$result = $a === $b;
echo "Identical to: " . var_export($result, true) . "<br>";

// Not identical to
$result = $a !== $b;
echo "Not identical to: " . var_export($result, true) . "<br>";

// Greater than
$result = $a > $b;
echo "Greater than: " . var_export($result, true) . "<br>";

// Less than
$result = $a < $b;
echo "Less than: " . var_export($result, true) . "<br>";

// Greater than or equal to
$result = $a >= $b;
echo "Greater than or equal to: " . var_export($result, true) . "<br>";

// Less than or equal to
$result = $a <= $b;
echo "Less than or equal to: " . var_export($result, true) . "<br>";
```

These are just a few examples of operators in PHP. There are many more operators available for different purposes. Make sure to refer to the PHP documentation for a complete list and detailed explanations.
