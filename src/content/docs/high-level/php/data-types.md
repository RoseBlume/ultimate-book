## PHP Data Types

In PHP, there are several built-in data types that you can use to store different kinds of values. These data types include:

- **String**: Used to store a sequence of characters, such as "Hello, World!".
- **Integer**: Used to store whole numbers, such as 42 or -10.
- **Float**: Used to store decimal numbers, such as 3.14 or -2.5.
- **Boolean**: Used to store either true or false.
- **Array**: Used to store multiple values in a single variable.
- **Object**: Used to store instances of classes.
- **NULL**: Used to represent a variable with no value assigned.

You can declare variables and assign values to them using the appropriate data type. For example:

```php
$name = "John Doe"; // String
$age = 25; // Integer
$price = 9.99; // Float
$isStudent = true; // Boolean
$fruits = array("apple", "banana", "orange"); // Array
$person = new Person(); // Object
$address = null; // NULL
```

It's important to choose the correct data type based on the kind of value you want to store. PHP is a loosely typed language, which means that you don't need to explicitly declare the data type of a variable before using it.

You can also perform operations and manipulate data based on their data types. PHP provides various built-in functions and operators to work with different data types.

For more information on PHP data types, you can refer to the official PHP documentation.
