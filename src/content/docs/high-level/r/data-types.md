## Basic Data Types in R

R is a dynamically typed language, which means that variables can hold values of different types. Here are some of the basic data types in R:

### Numeric

Numeric data types in R represent numbers with decimal points. They can be either integers or floating-point numbers. For example:

```R
x <- 10
y <- 3.14
```

### Character

Character data types in R represent strings of text. They are enclosed in single or double quotes. For example:

```R
name <- "John Doe"
```

### Logical

Logical data types in R represent boolean values, which can be either `TRUE` or `FALSE`. For example:

```R
is_admin <- TRUE
```

### Integer

Integer data types in R represent whole numbers. They are created by adding an `L` suffix to the number. For example:

```R
count <- 100L
```

### Complex

Complex data types in R represent complex numbers with real and imaginary parts. They are created using the `complex()` function. For example:

```R
z <- complex(real = 3, imaginary = 4)
```

These are some of the basic data types in R. Understanding them is essential for working with variables and performing computations in R.
