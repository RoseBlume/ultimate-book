## Comments in R

In R, comments are used to add explanatory notes or annotations to your code. They are ignored by the R interpreter and are not executed as part of the program. Comments are useful for providing context, documenting your code, or temporarily disabling certain lines of code.

To add a comment in R, you can use the `#` symbol. Anything after the `#` symbol on the same line is considered a comment.

Here's an example:

```R
# This is a comment in R
# It provides additional information about the code

# This line of code calculates the sum of two numbers
result <- 10 + 5

# This line of code prints the result
print(result)
```

In the example above, the comments start with `#` and are used to explain what each line of code does. The comments are not executed by R, but they help other developers understand the code.

Remember to use comments sparingly and only include relevant information. Over-commenting can make your code harder to read.
