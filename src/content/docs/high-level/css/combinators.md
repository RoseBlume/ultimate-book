Combinators in CSS are selectors that allow you to target specific elements based on their relationship with other elements. There are four types of combinators in CSS: 

1. Descendant combinator (space): It selects an element that is a descendant of another element. For example, `div p` selects all `<p>` elements that are descendants of `<div>` elements.

2. Child combinator (>): It selects an element that is a direct child of another element. For example, `ul > li` selects all `<li>` elements that are direct children of `<ul>` elements.

3. Adjacent sibling combinator (+): It selects an element that is the next sibling of another element. For example, `h1 + p` selects the `<p>` element that is the next sibling of an `<h1>` element.

4. General sibling combinator (~): It selects all elements that are siblings of another element. For example, `h2 ~ p` selects all `<p>` elements that are siblings of an `<h2>` element.

Here are some examples:

```css
/* Descendant combinator */
div p {
    color: red;
}

/* Child combinator */
ul > li {
    font-weight: bold;
}

/* Adjacent sibling combinator */
h1 + p {
    margin-top: 10px;
}

/* General sibling combinator */
h2 ~ p {
    font-style: italic;
}
```

These combinators provide powerful ways to target specific elements in your CSS selectors based on their relationship with other elements.
