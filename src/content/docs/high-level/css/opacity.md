title: Opacity
description: A guide in my new Starlight docs site.

Opacity controls how solid an element appears. For example if an element has an opacity of 100% it would be completely solid, but if it had an opacity of 0% it would be transparent.
#### Example
```css
h1 {
    opacity: 100%; /*This appears completely solid*/
}
h2 {
    opacity: 0%; /*This element is transparent*/
}
h3 {
    opacity: 50%; /*This element is semi-transparent*/
}
```
