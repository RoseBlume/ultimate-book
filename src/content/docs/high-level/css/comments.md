Comments in CSS are a way to add notes or explanations to your code that are not interpreted by the browser. They are useful for documenting your styles or temporarily disabling a block of code.

To add a comment in CSS, you can use the `/* */` syntax. Anything between these two symbols will be ignored by the browser when rendering the page.

Here's an example of a CSS comment:

```css
/* This is a comment */
```

You can also use comments to provide additional information about specific styles or sections of your code. This can be helpful for yourself or other developers who may need to understand or modify your code in the future.

It's important to note that comments should be used sparingly and only when necessary. Too many comments can clutter your code and make it harder to read and maintain.

Remember to always start and end your comments with `/*` and `*/` respectively, and keep them concise and relevant to the code they are associated with.
