Pseudo classes in CSS allow you to select and style elements based on their state or position within the document tree. They are denoted by a colon followed by the pseudo class name.

Here are some commonly used pseudo classes:

1. :hover - Selects an element when the mouse pointer is over it.
Example:
```css
a:hover {
    color: red;
}
```

2. :active - Selects an element when it is being activated by the user.
Example:
```css
button:active {
    background-color: blue;
}
```

3. :focus - Selects an element when it has focus.
Example:
```css
input:focus {
    border: 2px solid green;
}
```

4. :first-child - Selects the first child element of its parent.
Example:
```css
ul li:first-child {
    font-weight: bold;
}
```

5. :nth-child() - Selects elements based on their position within their parent.
Example:
```css
ul li:nth-child(odd) {
    background-color: lightgray;
}
```

These are just a few examples of the many pseudo classes available in CSS. They provide powerful ways to style elements based on various conditions and states.
