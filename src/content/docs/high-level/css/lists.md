List Customization in CSS
========================

CSS provides a wide range of options for customizing lists. You can modify the appearance of list items, change bullet styles, and even create your own custom markers. Here are a few examples:

1. Changing Bullet Styles
------------------------
You can change the default bullet style of an unordered list using the `list-style-type` property. For example, to use square bullets, you can add the following CSS rule:

```css
ul {
    list-style-type: square;
}
```

2. Customizing Numbered Lists
----------------------------
To customize the appearance of numbered lists, you can use the `list-style-type` property with different values. For instance, to use Roman numerals, you can apply the following CSS rule:

```css
ol {
    list-style-type: upper-roman;
}
```

3. Creating Custom Markers
--------------------------
CSS also allows you to create your own custom markers for lists. You can use images, icons, or even Unicode characters as markers. Here's an example of using a custom image as a bullet:

```css
ul {
    list-style-image: url('bullet.png');
}
```

Conclusion
----------
With CSS, you have the power to customize lists in various ways. Whether you want to change bullet styles, modify numbering formats, or create custom markers, CSS provides the flexibility to make your lists visually appealing and unique.
