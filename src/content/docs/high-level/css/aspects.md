In CSS, an objects dimensions can be specified using the `width` and `height` properties.

#### Example
```css
p {
    width: 500px;
    height: 700px;
}
```

Furthermore, these properties can use the `vw`, `vy`, and `%` units.
The `vw` unit changes an elements width to the number of pixels that occupies the given numbers percentage of the screen width. For example if the width is `50vw` the object will take up 50% of the screens width.

#### Example
This shows a paragraph that has a height and width equal to that of the screens total width.
```css
p {
    width: 50vw;
    height: 50vw;
}
```

One can also specify the `height` and `width` properties as a percentage

#### Example
```css
p {
    width: 50%;
    height: 50%;
}
```
