Gradients in CSS allow you to create smooth transitions between two or more colors. They are a great way to add depth and visual interest to your web pages. Here's an example of how you can use gradients in CSS:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Gradients Example</title>
    <style>
        body {
            background: linear-gradient(to right, #ff0000, #0000ff);
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Gradients Example</h1>
    <p>This is an example of using gradients in CSS.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

In the above example, we use the `linear-gradient` function to create a gradient that transitions from red (#ff0000) to blue (#0000ff) horizontally from left to right. You can customize the direction and colors of the gradient to achieve different effects.

Remember to place the CSS code within the `<style>` tags in the `<head>` section of your HTML document. This is called internal CSS, as the styles are defined within the HTML file itself.

Experiment with different color combinations and gradient directions to create unique and visually appealing designs. Gradients can be applied to various CSS properties such as backgrounds, borders, and text.
