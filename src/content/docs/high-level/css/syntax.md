CSS Syntax
=================

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to describe the look and formatting of a document written in HTML. Understanding the syntax of CSS is essential for creating visually appealing web pages.

Selectors
-----------------
Selectors are used to target specific HTML elements and apply styles to them. Here are some examples of CSS selectors:

- Element Selector: Targets all instances of a specific HTML element. For example, `p` targets all `<p>` elements.
- Class Selector: Targets elements with a specific class attribute. For example, `.my-class` targets all elements with `class="my-class"`.
- ID Selector: Targets an element with a specific ID attribute. For example, `#my-id` targets the element with `id="my-id"`.

Properties and Values
-----------------
CSS properties define the visual appearance of an element, while values specify the specific settings for those properties. Here are some examples of CSS properties and values:

- `color`: Specifies the text color. For example, `color: red;` sets the text color to red.
- `font-size`: Specifies the size of the font. For example, `font-size: 16px;` sets the font size to 16 pixels.
- `background-color`: Specifies the background color. For example, `background-color: #f1f1f1;` sets the background color to light gray.

Selectors and Declarations
-----------------
Selectors and declarations are combined to create CSS rules. A CSS rule consists of a selector followed by a set of declarations enclosed in curly braces. Here is an example of a CSS rule:

```css
p {
    color: blue;
    font-size: 14px;
}
```

This rule targets all `<p>` elements and sets the text color to blue and the font size to 14 pixels.

Conclusion
-----------------
Understanding the syntax of CSS is crucial for creating visually appealing web pages. By using selectors, properties, and values, you can style HTML elements to achieve the desired look and feel.
