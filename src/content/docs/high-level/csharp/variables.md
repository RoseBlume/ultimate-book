# Variables in C#

In C#, variables are used to store and manipulate data. They provide a way to give names to values and refer to them later in the program.

## Declaring Variables

To declare a variable in C#, you need to specify its type and name. Here's an example:

```csharp
int age;
```

In the above example, we declare a variable named `age` of type `int` (integer).

## Initializing Variables

You can also initialize a variable at the time of declaration. Here's an example:

```csharp
int score = 100;
```

In the above example, we declare and initialize a variable named `score` of type `int` with the value `100`.

## Using Variables

Once a variable is declared and initialized, you can use it in your program. Here's an example:

```csharp
int x = 5;
int y = 10;
int sum = x + y;
Console.WriteLine("The sum of x and y is: " + sum);
```

In the above example, we declare and initialize two variables `x` and `y`, and then calculate their sum and store it in the variable `sum`. Finally, we print the result using the `Console.WriteLine` method.

## Conclusion

Variables are an essential concept in C# programming. They allow you to store and manipulate data, making your programs more dynamic and flexible.

Remember to choose appropriate variable names and use the correct data types based on the values you want to store.
