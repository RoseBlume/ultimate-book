Access modifiers in C# are keywords that specify the accessibility of types and members in a program. They control the visibility and accessibility of classes, methods, properties, and other members.

There are five access modifiers in C#:

1. **public**: The public access modifier allows a type or member to be accessed from any other code in the same assembly or in a different assembly that references it.

```csharp
public class MyClass
{
    public int MyProperty { get; set; }
    
    public void MyMethod()
    {
        // Code goes here
    }
}
```

2. **private**: The private access modifier restricts the accessibility of a type or member to within its own class. It cannot be accessed from outside the class.

```csharp
public class MyClass
{
    private int myField;
    
    private void MyMethod()
    {
        // Code goes here
    }
}
```

3. **protected**: The protected access modifier allows a type or member to be accessed within its own class and by derived classes.

```csharp
public class MyBaseClass
{
    protected int myField;
}

public class MyDerivedClass : MyBaseClass
{
    public void MyMethod()
    {
        myField = 10; // Accessing protected member from derived class
    }
}
```

4. **internal**: The internal access modifier allows a type or member to be accessed within the same assembly, but not from another assembly.

```csharp
internal class MyClass
{
    internal int MyProperty { get; set; }
    
    internal void MyMethod()
    {
        // Code goes here
    }
}
```

5. **protected internal**: The protected internal access modifier allows a type or member to be accessed within the same assembly or by derived classes, even if they are in a different assembly.

```csharp
public class MyBaseClass
{
    protected internal int myField;
}

public class MyDerivedClass : MyBaseClass
{
    public void MyMethod()
    {
        myField = 10; // Accessing protected internal member from derived class
    }
}
```

Understanding access modifiers is crucial for designing well-structured and secure C# programs.
