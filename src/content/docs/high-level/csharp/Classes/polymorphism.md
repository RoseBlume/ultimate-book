# Polymorphism in C#

Polymorphism is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common base type. This enables code to be written that can work with objects of different classes, providing flexibility and extensibility.

## Method Overriding

One way to achieve polymorphism in C# is through method overriding. Method overriding allows a derived class to provide its own implementation of a method that is already defined in its base class. This allows objects of the derived class to be used interchangeably with objects of the base class.

Here's an example:

```csharp
public class Shape
{
    public virtual void Draw()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Drawing a shape");
    }
}

public class Circle : Shape
{
    public override void Draw()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Drawing a circle");
    }
}

public class Square : Shape
{
    public override void Draw()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Drawing a square");
    }
}

public class Program
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        Shape shape1 = new Circle();
        Shape shape2 = new Square();

        shape1.Draw(); // Output: Drawing a circle
        shape2.Draw(); // Output: Drawing a square
    }
}
```

In the above example, the `Shape` class defines a virtual method `Draw()`, which is then overridden in the `Circle` and `Square` classes. The `Main()` method demonstrates polymorphism by creating objects of the derived classes and calling the `Draw()` method on them.

## Conclusion

Polymorphism is a powerful concept in C# that allows for code reusability and flexibility. By leveraging method overriding, objects of different classes can be treated as objects of a common base type, enabling more generic and extensible code.
