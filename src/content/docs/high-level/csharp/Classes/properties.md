## Properties in C#

In C#, properties provide a way to encapsulate data and control access to it. They are a combination of a field and methods that allow getting and setting the value of the field.

### Syntax

The syntax for defining a property in C# is as follows:

```csharp
public <data_type> <property_name> { get; set; }
```

Here, `<data_type>` represents the type of the property, and `<property_name>` is the name of the property.

### Example

```csharp
public class Person
{
    private string name;

    public string Name
    {
        get { return name; }
        set { name = value; }
    }
}

// Usage
Person person = new Person();
person.Name = "John";
Console.WriteLine(person.Name); // Output: John
```

In the above example, we have a `Person` class with a `Name` property. The property has a private field `name` and uses the `get` and `set` accessors to control access to it.

Properties provide a way to encapsulate data and add logic to the accessors if needed. They are widely used in C# to ensure data integrity and provide a clean interface for accessing and modifying object state.

For more information on properties in C#, you can refer to the [Microsoft documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/properties).
