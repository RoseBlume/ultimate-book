# Interfaces

In C#, an interface defines a contract that a class must adhere to. It specifies a set of methods, properties, and events that the implementing class must provide.

Here's an example of an interface declaration:

```csharp
public interface IShape
{
    void Draw();
    double CalculateArea();
}
```

To implement an interface, a class must use the `implements` keyword and provide implementations for all the members defined in the interface. For example:

```csharp
public class Circle : IShape
{
    public void Draw()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Drawing a circle");
    }

    public double CalculateArea()
    {
        // Calculate and return the area of the circle
    }
}
```

## Multiple Interfaces

A class in C# can implement multiple interfaces. This allows the class to inherit and provide implementations for multiple sets of methods, properties, and events.

Here's an example of a class implementing multiple interfaces:

```csharp
public interface IResizable
{
    void Resize(int width, int height);
}

public class Rectangle : IShape, IResizable
{
    public void Draw()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Drawing a rectangle");
    }

    public double CalculateArea()
    {
        // Calculate and return the area of the rectangle
    }

    public void Resize(int width, int height)
    {
        // Resize the rectangle to the specified width and height
    }
}
```

In the above example, the `Rectangle` class implements both the `IShape` and `IResizable` interfaces.

Remember, interfaces provide a way to achieve abstraction and define contracts for classes to follow. They are a powerful tool in C# programming.
