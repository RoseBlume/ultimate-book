# Abstraction in C#

Abstraction is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that allows us to hide complex implementation details and only expose the essential features of an object. It helps in creating more modular and maintainable code.

In C#, abstraction is achieved through the use of abstract classes and interfaces.

## Abstract Classes

An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and is meant to be inherited by other classes. It can contain both abstract and non-abstract methods.

```csharp
public abstract class Shape
{
    public abstract double CalculateArea();
    public void Display()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("This is a shape.");
    }
}

public class Circle : Shape
{
    public override double CalculateArea()
    {
        // Calculate area of circle
    }
}

public class Rectangle : Shape
{
    public override double CalculateArea()
    {
        // Calculate area of rectangle
    }
}
```

In the above example, the `Shape` class is an abstract class that defines the `CalculateArea` method as an abstract method. The `Circle` and `Rectangle` classes inherit from the `Shape` class and provide their own implementation of the `CalculateArea` method.

## Interfaces

An interface is a contract that defines a set of methods and properties that a class must implement. It provides a way to achieve multiple inheritance in C#.

```csharp
public interface IResizable
{
    void Resize(int width, int height);
}

public class Image : IResizable
{
    public void Resize(int width, int height)
    {
        // Resize the image
    }
}

public class Button : IResizable
{
    public void Resize(int width, int height)
    {
        // Resize the button
    }
}
```

In the above example, the `IResizable` interface defines the `Resize` method that must be implemented by any class that implements the interface. The `Image` and `Button` classes both implement the `IResizable` interface and provide their own implementation of the `Resize` method.

Abstraction is a powerful concept in C# that allows us to create flexible and extensible code. By hiding implementation details and only exposing essential features, we can create more maintainable and scalable applications.
