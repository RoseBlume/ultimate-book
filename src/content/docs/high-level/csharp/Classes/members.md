# Class Members

In C#, class members are the variables, methods, properties, events, and indexers that are defined within a class. They define the behavior and data associated with the class.

## Variables

Variables are used to store data within a class. They can be of different types, such as integers, strings, or custom objects. Here's an example of declaring and initializing a variable in C#:

```csharp
int age = 25;
string name = "John";
```

## Methods

Methods are used to define the behavior of a class. They can perform specific actions or calculations. Here's an example of a method in C#:

```csharp
public void SayHello()
{
    Console.WriteLine("Hello, world!");
}
```

## Properties

Properties provide a way to access and modify the data stored in a class. They encapsulate the internal state of an object. Here's an example of a property in C#:

```csharp
private string _name;

public string Name
{
    get { return _name; }
    set { _name = value; }
}
```

## Events

Events are used to notify other parts of the program when something happens within a class. They allow for communication between different components. Here's an example of an event in C#:

```csharp
public event EventHandler ButtonClicked;

private void OnButtonClicked()
{
    ButtonClicked?.Invoke(this, EventArgs.Empty);
}
```

## Indexers

Indexers provide a way to access elements in a class using an index. They are similar to properties but allow for accessing elements using an index value. Here's an example of an indexer in C#:

```csharp
private string[] _names = { "John", "Jane", "Alice" };

public string this[int index]
{
    get { return _names[index]; }
    set { _names[index] = value; }
}
```

These are some of the class members that can be defined in C#. They allow for creating reusable and modular code.
