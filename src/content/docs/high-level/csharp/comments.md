In C#, comments are used to add explanatory notes or annotations to the code. They are ignored by the compiler and do not affect the execution of the program.

There are two types of comments in C#:

1. Single-line comments: These comments start with `//` and continue until the end of the line. They are typically used for short explanations or to disable a line of code temporarily. For example:

```csharp
// This is a single-line comment
int x = 5; // This line assigns the value 5 to the variable x
```

2. Multi-line comments: These comments start with `/*` and end with `*/`. They can span multiple lines and are often used for longer explanations or to comment out a block of code. For example:

```csharp
/*
This is a multi-line comment.
It can span multiple lines.
*/

/*
int y = 10;
Console.WriteLine(y);
*/
```

Comments are a useful tool for documenting your code and making it more understandable for yourself and others who may read it.

Remember to use comments sparingly and only when necessary. Over-commenting can make the code harder to read and maintain.
