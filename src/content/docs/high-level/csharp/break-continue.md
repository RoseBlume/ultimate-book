## Break Statement

The `break` statement is used to exit a loop prematurely. It is commonly used in situations where you want to terminate the loop based on a certain condition.

Here's an example of using the `break` statement in a `for` loop:

```csharp
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
{
    if (i == 5)
    {
        break;
    }
    Console.WriteLine(i);
}
```

In this example, the loop will iterate from 0 to 9. However, when `i` becomes 5, the `break` statement is encountered, and the loop is terminated.

## Continue Statement

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of a loop. It is commonly used in situations where you want to skip certain iterations based on a certain condition.

Here's an example of using the `continue` statement in a `while` loop:

```csharp
int i = 0;
while (i < 10)
{
    i++;
    if (i % 2 == 0)
    {
        continue;
    }
    Console.WriteLine(i);
}
```

In this example, the loop will iterate from 1 to 10. However, when `i` is an even number, the `continue` statement is encountered, and the rest of the code in the current iteration is skipped.

Remember to use the `break` and `continue` statements judiciously to control the flow of your loops effectively.
