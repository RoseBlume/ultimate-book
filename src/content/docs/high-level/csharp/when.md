# When Statement

The `when` statement is used in C# to add conditions to a pattern-matching expression. It allows you to specify additional criteria that must be met for a pattern to match.

Here's an example of using the `when` statement:

```csharp
int number = 5;

switch (number)
{
    case < 0:
        Console.WriteLine("Negative number");
        break;
    case > 0 when number % 2 == 0:
        Console.WriteLine("Positive even number");
        break;
    case > 0 when number % 2 != 0:
        Console.WriteLine("Positive odd number");
        break;
    default:
        Console.WriteLine("Zero");
        break;
}
```

In the above example, the `when` statement is used to add conditions to the `case` statements. The first `case` checks if the number is less than 0, the second `case` checks if the number is greater than 0 and even, and the third `case` checks if the number is greater than 0 and odd. The `default` case is executed if none of the previous cases match.

The `when` statement is a powerful feature in C# that allows you to add additional conditions to pattern matching, making your code more expressive and flexible.
