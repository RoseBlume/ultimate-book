# Data Types

In C#, data types define the type of data that can be stored in a variable. Here are some commonly used data types in C#:

- `int`: Represents whole numbers.
- `float`: Represents single-precision floating-point numbers.
- `double`: Represents double-precision floating-point numbers.
- `bool`: Represents boolean values (`true` or `false`).
- `string`: Represents a sequence of characters.

Here are some examples of using these data types in C#:

```csharp
int age = 25;
float temperature = 98.6f;
double pi = 3.14159;
bool isTrue = true;
string name = "John Doe";
```

You can also declare variables without explicitly specifying the data type using the `var` keyword, which allows the compiler to infer the data type based on the assigned value:

```csharp
var count = 10;
var price = 9.99;
var isValid = true;
var message = "Hello, world!";
```

These are just a few examples of the data types available in C#. Understanding data types is essential for writing robust and efficient C# programs.
