# Operators in C#

Operators in C# are symbols that perform specific operations on one or more operands. They are used to manipulate data and perform calculations. Here are some commonly used operators in C#:

## Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are used to perform basic mathematical operations. Here are some examples:

```csharp
int a = 10;
int b = 5;

int sum = a + b; // Addition
int difference = a - b; // Subtraction
int product = a * b; // Multiplication
int quotient = a / b; // Division
int remainder = a % b; // Modulus
```

## Comparison Operators

Comparison operators are used to compare two values and return a boolean result. Here are some examples:

```csharp
int x = 10;
int y = 5;

bool isEqual = x == y; // Equal to
bool isNotEqual = x != y; // Not equal to
bool isGreater = x > y; // Greater than
bool isLess = x < y; // Less than
bool isGreaterOrEqual = x >= y; // Greater than or equal to
bool isLessOrEqual = x <= y; // Less than or equal to
```

## Logical Operators

Logical operators are used to combine multiple conditions and evaluate the result. Here are some examples:

```csharp
bool condition1 = true;
bool condition2 = false;

bool result1 = condition1 && condition2; // Logical AND
bool result2 = condition1 || condition2; // Logical OR
bool result3 = !condition1; // Logical NOT
```

These are just a few examples of operators in C#. There are many more operators available for different purposes. Understanding and using operators effectively is essential for writing efficient and concise code in C#.
