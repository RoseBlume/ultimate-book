Python provides several built-in data types that allow you to store and manipulate different kinds of data. Here are some commonly used data types in Python:

1. Numeric Types:
    - int: Represents integers, such as 1, 2, -3, etc.
    - float: Represents floating-point numbers, such as 3.14, -2.5, etc.
    - complex: Represents complex numbers, such as 2+3j, -1-4j, etc.

2. Sequence Types:
    - str: Represents strings of characters, such as "hello", 'world', etc.
    - list: Represents ordered, mutable sequences, such as [1, 2, 3], ['a', 'b', 'c'], etc.
    - tuple: Represents ordered, immutable sequences, such as (1, 2, 3), ('a', 'b', 'c'), etc.

3. Mapping Type:
    - dict: Represents key-value pairs, such as {'name': 'John', 'age': 25}, {'city': 'New York', 'population': 1000000}, etc.

4. Set Types:
    - set: Represents an unordered collection of unique elements, such as {1, 2, 3}, {'apple', 'banana', 'orange'}, etc.
    - frozenset: Represents an immutable set, such as frozenset({1, 2, 3}), frozenset({'apple', 'banana', 'orange'}), etc.

5. Boolean Type:
    - bool: Represents either True or False.

6. None Type:
    - None: Represents the absence of a value.

Here are some examples:

```python
# Numeric Types
age = 25
pi = 3.14
complex_num = 2 + 3j

# Sequence Types
name = "John"
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
coordinates = (10, 20)

# Mapping Type
person = {'name': 'John', 'age': 25}

# Set Types
fruits = {'apple', 'banana', 'orange'}
unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3}

# Boolean Type
is_true = True
is_false = False

# None Type
no_value = None
```

These are just a few examples of the data types available in Python. Understanding and utilizing these data types is essential for effective programming in Python.
