## Introduction to Numbers in Python

In Python, numbers are a fundamental data type used to represent numerical values. There are three main types of numbers in Python: integers, floating-point numbers, and complex numbers.

### Integers

Integers, also known as whole numbers, are used to represent positive and negative whole numbers without any decimal points. In Python, you can define an integer by assigning a value to a variable.

```python
# Example: defining an integer
x = 10
```

### Floating-Point Numbers

Floating-point numbers, also known as floats, are used to represent numbers with decimal points. In Python, you can define a floating-point number by assigning a value with a decimal point to a variable.

```python
# Example: defining a floating-point number
y = 3.14
```

### Complex Numbers

Complex numbers are used to represent numbers with both a real and imaginary part. In Python, you can define a complex number by using the `j` or `J` suffix to represent the imaginary part.

```python
# Example: defining a complex number
z = 2 + 3j
```


### Conclusion

In this tutorial, you learned about the different types of numbers in Python and how to perform basic arithmetic operations. Now you can start working with numbers in your Python programs!
