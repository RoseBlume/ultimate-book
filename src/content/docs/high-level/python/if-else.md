## If-Else Statements in Python

In Python, the `if-else` statement is used to perform different actions based on different conditions. It allows the program to make decisions and execute different blocks of code depending on the outcome of a condition.

Here's the basic syntax of an `if-else` statement in Python:

```python
if condition:
    # code to be executed if the condition is true
else:
    # code to be executed if the condition is false
```

The `condition` is an expression that evaluates to either `True` or `False`. If the condition is `True`, the code block under the `if` statement is executed. If the condition is `False`, the code block under the `else` statement is executed.

Here's an example that demonstrates the usage of `if-else` statement in Python:

```python
x = 10

if x > 0:
    print("x is positive")
else:
    print("x is non-positive")
```

In this example, if the value of `x` is greater than `0`, the program will print "x is positive". Otherwise, it will print "x is non-positive".

You can also use multiple `elif` (short for "else if") statements to handle multiple conditions. Here's an example:

```python
x = 0

if x > 0:
    print("x is positive")
elif x < 0:
    print("x is negative")
else:
    print("x is zero")
```

In this example, if `x` is greater than `0`, it prints "x is positive". If `x` is less than `0`, it prints "x is negative". Otherwise, it prints "x is zero".

The `if-else` statement is a powerful tool in Python that allows you to control the flow of your program based on different conditions. It is commonly used in decision-making scenarios and helps in writing more dynamic and flexible code.
