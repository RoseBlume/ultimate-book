Casting in Python allows you to convert one data type to another. This can be useful when you need to perform operations or comparisons between different types of data.

Here are some examples of casting in Python:

1. Integer to Float:
```python
x = 5
y = float(x)
print(y)  # Output: 5.0
```

2. Float to Integer:
```python
x = 3.14
y = int(x)
print(y)  # Output: 3
```

3. String to Integer:
```python
x = "10"
y = int(x)
print(y)  # Output: 10
```

Remember to handle exceptions when casting, as it may raise errors if the conversion is not possible.
