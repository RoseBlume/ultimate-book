## Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations in Python. Here are the commonly used arithmetic operators:

- Addition: `+`
- Subtraction: `-`
- Multiplication: `*`
- Division: `/`
- Modulus: `%`
- Exponentiation: `**`
- Floor Division: `//`

### Example:

```python
# Addition
result = 5 + 3
print(result)  # Output: 8

# Subtraction
result = 10 - 4
print(result)  # Output: 6

# Multiplication
result = 2 * 6
print(result)  # Output: 12

# Division
result = 15 / 3
print(result)  # Output: 5.0

# Modulus
result = 17 % 5
print(result)  # Output: 2

# Exponentiation
result = 2 ** 3
print(result)  # Output: 8

# Floor Division
result = 17 // 5
print(result)  # Output: 3
```

Remember to use parentheses to control the order of operations when necessary.
