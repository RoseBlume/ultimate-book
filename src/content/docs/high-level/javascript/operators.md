Operators in JavaScript are symbols or keywords that perform operations on operands (values or variables). They are used to manipulate and perform calculations on data.

JavaScript provides various types of operators, including:

1. Arithmetic Operators: These operators perform mathematical calculations such as addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and modulus (%).

2. Assignment Operators: These operators are used to assign values to variables. Examples include the assignment operator (=), addition assignment operator (+=), subtraction assignment operator (-=), and so on.

3. Comparison Operators: These operators compare two values and return a boolean result. Examples include the equality operator (==), strict equality operator (===), greater than operator (>), less than operator (<), and so on.

4. Logical Operators: These operators are used to combine or negate boolean values. Examples include the logical AND operator (&&), logical OR operator (||), and logical NOT operator (!).

5. Bitwise Operators: These operators perform bitwise operations on binary representations of numbers. Examples include the bitwise AND operator (&), bitwise OR operator (|), bitwise XOR operator (^), and so on.

6. Unary Operators: These operators operate on a single operand. Examples include the unary plus operator (+), unary minus operator (-), increment operator (++), and decrement operator (--).

7. Ternary Operator: This operator is a shorthand for an if-else statement. It takes three operands and returns a value based on a condition. The syntax is `condition ? expression1 : expression2`.

These are just a few examples of the operators available in JavaScript. Understanding and using operators effectively is crucial for writing efficient and concise code.
