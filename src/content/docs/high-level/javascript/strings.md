Strings in JavaScript are sequences of characters enclosed in single quotes ('') or double quotes (""). They are used to represent text and are one of the fundamental data types in the language.

In JavaScript, strings are immutable, which means that once a string is created, it cannot be changed. However, you can perform various operations on strings to manipulate and extract information from them.

Some common operations on strings include concatenation, which is done using the '+' operator, and string interpolation, which allows you to embed expressions within a string using template literals (`${expression}`). You can also access individual characters in a string using bracket notation (e.g., myString[0]).

JavaScript provides a rich set of built-in methods for working with strings. These methods allow you to perform tasks such as finding the length of a string (myString.length), converting a string to uppercase or lowercase (myString.toUpperCase(), myString.toLowerCase()), and searching for a substring within a string (myString.indexOf('substring')).

Additionally, JavaScript supports Unicode characters, which means that you can use characters from different languages and scripts in your strings. You can even use escape sequences to represent special characters, such as newline (\n) or tab (\t).

Overall, strings are a crucial part of JavaScript programming, and understanding how to work with them effectively is essential for building robust and dynamic applications.
