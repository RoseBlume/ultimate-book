## Introduction to SQL Data Types

In SQL, data types define the type of data that can be stored in a column or variable. Each data type has specific characteristics and storage requirements.

### Numeric Data Types

- `INT`: Represents whole numbers.
- `FLOAT`: Represents floating-point numbers.
- `DECIMAL`: Represents fixed-point numbers with a specified precision and scale.

### Character Data Types

- `CHAR`: Represents fixed-length character strings.
- `VARCHAR`: Represents variable-length character strings.
- `TEXT`: Represents large character strings.

### Date and Time Data Types

- `DATE`: Represents a date value.
- `TIME`: Represents a time value.
- `DATETIME`: Represents a combination of date and time values.

### Other Data Types

- `BOOLEAN`: Represents boolean values (true or false).
- `BLOB`: Represents binary large objects.
- `ENUM`: Represents a predefined set of values.

It's important to choose the appropriate data type for each column or variable to ensure data integrity and optimize storage space.

For more detailed information on SQL data types, refer to the documentation of your specific database management system.
