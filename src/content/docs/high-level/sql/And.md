## SQL AND Operator

The SQL `AND` operator is used to combine multiple conditions in a `WHERE` clause. It allows you to retrieve records that satisfy all the specified conditions.

### Syntax

The basic syntax of the `AND` operator is as follows:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition1 AND condition2 AND condition3 ...;
```

### Example

Let's say we have a table called `employees` with the following columns: `id`, `name`, `age`, and `salary`. We want to retrieve all the employees who are older than 30 and have a salary greater than $50,000.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE age > 30 AND salary > 50000;
```

This query will return all the records that satisfy both conditions.

### Notes

- The `AND` operator requires all the conditions to be true for a record to be included in the result set.
- You can combine multiple `AND` operators to create complex conditions.

Remember to use the `AND` operator judiciously to ensure that your queries return the desired results.
