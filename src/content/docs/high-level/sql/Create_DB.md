```sql
CREATE DATABASE database_name;
```

To create a new database in SQL, you can use the `CREATE DATABASE` statement followed by the desired name for your database. For example, to create a database called `database_name`, you would use the following SQL code:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE database_name;
```

Make sure to replace `database_name` with the actual name you want to give to your database.

Once the database is created, you can start using it to store and manipulate data using SQL queries.

Remember to properly manage your databases, including backups and security measures, to ensure the integrity and availability of your data.
