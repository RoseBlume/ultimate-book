```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name;
```
In this introductory lesson, we will explore the basics of SQL (Structured Query Language). SQL is a powerful language used for managing and manipulating relational databases.

To retrieve data from a table, we use the `SELECT` statement followed by the columns we want to retrieve, or `*` to select all columns. In the example above, `table_name` should be replaced with the actual name of the table you want to query.

Stay tuned for more SQL tutorials where we will dive deeper into various SQL operations and concepts.

Happy coding!
