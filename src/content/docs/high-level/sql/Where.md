```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```

In SQL, the `WHERE` clause is used to filter records based on a specified condition. It allows you to retrieve only the rows that meet the specified criteria.

The syntax of the `WHERE` clause is as follows:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

Here, `table_name` is the name of the table from which you want to retrieve data. `condition` is the condition that must be met for a row to be included in the result set.

For example, let's say we have a table called `employees` with columns `id`, `name`, and `salary`. If we want to retrieve all the employees whose salary is greater than 5000, we can use the following query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary > 5000;
```

This query will return all the rows from the `employees` table where the `salary` column is greater than 5000.

You can also use logical operators such as `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` to combine multiple conditions in the `WHERE` clause. For example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary > 5000 AND department = 'IT';
```

This query will return all the rows from the `employees` table where the `salary` column is greater than 5000 and the `department` column is 'IT'.

Remember, the `WHERE` clause is a powerful tool that allows you to filter data based on specific conditions in SQL queries. It helps you retrieve only the data you need from a table.
