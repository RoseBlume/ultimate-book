-- Not Null

In SQL, the `NOT NULL` constraint is used to ensure that a column does not contain any null values. 

When a column is defined with the `NOT NULL` constraint, it means that every row in the table must have a value for that column. If a null value is inserted or updated into a column with the `NOT NULL` constraint, an error will occur.

Here's an example of creating a table with a column that has the `NOT NULL` constraint:

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
  id INT NOT NULL,
  name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  age INT
);
```

In the above example, both the `id` and `name` columns have the `NOT NULL` constraint. This means that every row in the `employees` table must have a non-null value for both `id` and `name`.

If you try to insert a row without providing a value for the `id` or `name` column, an error will be thrown.

The `NOT NULL` constraint is useful when you want to enforce data integrity and ensure that certain columns always have values.
