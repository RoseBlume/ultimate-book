## Introduction to the NOT Operator in SQL

In SQL, the `NOT` operator is used to negate a condition or expression. It is often used in conjunction with other operators to create more complex conditions.

### Syntax

The syntax of the `NOT` operator is as follows:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE NOT condition;
```

### Example

Consider the following table named `employees`:

| id | name   | age | salary |
|----|--------|-----|--------|
| 1  | John   | 25  | 5000   |
| 2  | Alice  | 30  | 6000   |
| 3  | Bob    | 35  | 7000   |
| 4  | Claire | 40  | 8000   |

To retrieve all the employees who are not 30 years old, you can use the `NOT` operator as follows:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE NOT age = 30;
```

This query will return the following result:

| id | name   | age | salary |
|----|--------|-----|--------|
| 1  | John   | 25  | 5000   |
| 3  | Bob    | 35  | 7000   |
| 4  | Claire | 40  | 8000   |

### Conclusion

The `NOT` operator is a powerful tool in SQL that allows you to negate conditions and expressions. It can be used to filter data based on specific criteria.
