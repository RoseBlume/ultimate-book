```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;
```
The `SELECT` statement is used to retrieve data from a database. It allows you to specify which columns you want to retrieve from a table. You can select one or multiple columns by separating them with commas.

To use the `SELECT` statement, you need to specify the table name from which you want to retrieve data. This is done using the `FROM` keyword followed by the table name.

For example, to select all columns from a table called `employees`, the SQL query would be:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees;
```

You can also specify specific columns to retrieve by listing them after the `SELECT` keyword. For example, to select only the `name` and `age` columns from the `employees` table, the SQL query would be:

```sql
SELECT name, age
FROM employees;
```

Additionally, you can use the `DISTINCT` keyword to retrieve unique values from a column. For example, to select all unique values from the `city` column in the `employees` table, the SQL query would be:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT city
FROM employees;
```

These are just some basic examples of using the `SELECT` statement in SQL. There are many more advanced features and clauses that can be used to retrieve and manipulate data.
