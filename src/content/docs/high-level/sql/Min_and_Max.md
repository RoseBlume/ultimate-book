```sql
SELECT MIN(column_name) FROM table_name;
```

The `MIN()` function is used to retrieve the minimum value from a column in a table.

```sql
SELECT MAX(column_name) FROM table_name;
```

The `MAX()` function is used to retrieve the maximum value from a column in a table.

These functions are commonly used in SQL to find the smallest and largest values in a dataset.

For example, if we have a table called `employees` with a column `salary`, we can use the `MIN()` function to find the employee with the lowest salary:

```sql
SELECT MIN(salary) FROM employees;
```

Similarly, we can use the `MAX()` function to find the employee with the highest salary:

```sql
SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees;
```

These functions can be very useful when analyzing data and finding extreme values in a dataset.

Remember to always specify the column name and the table name when using these functions in your SQL queries.

For more information, you can refer to the [SQL documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/group-by-functions.html#function_min) on the `MIN()` and `MAX()` functions.
