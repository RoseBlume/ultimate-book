## SQL Operators

In SQL, operators are used to perform various operations on data. They allow you to manipulate and compare values, perform arithmetic calculations, and more. Here are some commonly used operators in SQL:

### Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical calculations on numeric data types. The following arithmetic operators are supported in SQL:

- Addition: `+`
- Subtraction: `-`
- Multiplication: `*`
- Division: `/`
- Modulo: `%`

### Comparison Operators

Comparison operators are used to compare values in SQL. They return a boolean value (`TRUE` or `FALSE`) based on the comparison result. The following comparison operators are supported in SQL:

- Equal to: `=`
- Not equal to: `<>` or `!=`
- Greater than: `>`
- Less than: `<`
- Greater than or equal to: `>=`
- Less than or equal to: `<=`

### Logical Operators

Logical operators are used to combine multiple conditions in SQL. They allow you to perform logical operations such as AND, OR, and NOT. The following logical operators are supported in SQL:

- AND: `AND`
- OR: `OR`
- NOT: `NOT`

### String Operators

String operators are used to manipulate and concatenate strings in SQL. The following string operators are supported in SQL:

- Concatenation: `||`
- Pattern matching: `LIKE`

These are just some of the operators available in SQL. Understanding and using operators effectively is essential for writing powerful and efficient SQL queries.
