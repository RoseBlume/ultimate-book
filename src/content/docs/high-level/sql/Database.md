## Introduction to SQL Databases

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a powerful language used for managing and manipulating relational databases. In this lesson, we will explore the fundamentals of SQL databases and learn how to perform common operations.

### What is a Database?

A database is an organized collection of data stored and accessed electronically. It provides a structured way to store, retrieve, and manage data efficiently. SQL databases are based on the relational model, which organizes data into tables with rows and columns.

### SQL Basics

SQL allows us to perform various operations on a database, such as creating tables, inserting data, querying data, updating records, and deleting data. It provides a standardized way to interact with databases across different platforms.

### Creating a Database

To create a database, we use the `CREATE DATABASE` statement followed by the name of the database. For example:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE mydatabase;
```

### Creating Tables

Tables are used to store data in a structured format. We can create tables using the `CREATE TABLE` statement. Here's an example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE customers (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(50),
  email VARCHAR(100)
);
```

### Querying Data

To retrieve data from a table, we use the `SELECT` statement. It allows us to specify the columns we want to retrieve and apply conditions to filter the data. For example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM customers;
```

### Updating Records

To update existing records in a table, we use the `UPDATE` statement. It allows us to modify the values of specific columns based on certain conditions. Here's an example:

```sql
UPDATE customers
SET email = 'newemail@example.com'
WHERE id = 1;
```

### Deleting Data

To remove data from a table, we use the `DELETE` statement. It allows us to delete specific rows based on certain conditions. For example:

```sql
DELETE FROM customers
WHERE id = 1;
```

### Conclusion

In this lesson, we have covered the basics of SQL databases. We learned about creating databases, creating tables, querying data, updating records, and deleting data. SQL is a powerful language that allows us to manage and manipulate data efficiently. With further practice and exploration, you will become proficient in SQL and be able to work with databases effectively.
