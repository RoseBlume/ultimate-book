```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3, ...)
VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);
```

The `INSERT INTO` statement is used to insert new records into a table in a database. It specifies the table name and the columns to insert data into. The `VALUES` keyword is followed by a list of values to be inserted into the corresponding columns.

For example, to insert a new record into a table called `employees` with columns `id`, `name`, and `salary`, you can use the following SQL statement:

```sql
INSERT INTO employees (id, name, salary)
VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 50000);
```

This will insert a new record with an `id` of 1, a `name` of 'John Doe', and a `salary` of 50000 into the `employees` table.

You can also insert multiple records at once by specifying multiple sets of values separated by commas:

```sql
INSERT INTO employees (id, name, salary)
VALUES (2, 'Jane Smith', 60000),
  (3, 'Mike Johnson', 55000),
  (4, 'Emily Davis', 52000);
```

This will insert three new records into the `employees` table.

Remember to ensure that the values you are inserting match the data types of the corresponding columns in the table.

For more information on the `INSERT INTO` statement and other SQL commands, refer to the documentation of your specific database management system.
