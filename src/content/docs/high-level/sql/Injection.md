## What is SQL Injection?

SQL Injection is a common security vulnerability that occurs when an attacker can manipulate an SQL query by injecting malicious code into user input. This can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and even complete compromise of the database.

### How does SQL Injection work?

SQL Injection attacks typically exploit poorly validated user input that is directly concatenated into an SQL query. By injecting specially crafted input, an attacker can modify the intended behavior of the query and execute arbitrary SQL statements.

For example, consider the following vulnerable code snippet:

```sql
String query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + userInput + "' AND password = '" + password + "'";
```

In this case, if the `userInput` variable is not properly validated, an attacker can input something like `' OR '1'='1' --` as the username, effectively bypassing the password check and retrieving all user records from the database.

### Preventing SQL Injection

To prevent SQL Injection attacks, it is crucial to use parameterized queries or prepared statements. These techniques ensure that user input is properly sanitized and treated as data, rather than executable code.

Here's an example of using parameterized queries in SQL:

```sql
String query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?";
PreparedStatement statement = connection.prepareStatement(query);
statement.setString(1, userInput);
statement.setString(2, password);
ResultSet resultSet = statement.executeQuery();
```

By using parameterized queries, the SQL engine automatically handles the proper escaping and sanitization of user input, making it much more secure against SQL Injection attacks.

Additionally, it is important to follow secure coding practices such as input validation, least privilege principle, and regular security audits to ensure the overall security of the application.

Remember, preventing SQL Injection is not just the responsibility of the database layer, but also the application layer. All user input should be properly validated and sanitized before being used in SQL queries.
