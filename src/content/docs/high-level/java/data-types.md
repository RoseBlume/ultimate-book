# Data Types in Java

In Java, data types are used to define the type of data that a variable can hold. Here are some commonly used data types in Java:

1. **Primitive Data Types:**
   - `int`: Used to store whole numbers.
   - `double`: Used to store floating-point numbers.
   - `boolean`: Used to store true or false values.
   - `char`: Used to store single characters.
   
2. **Reference Data Types:**
   - `String`: Used to store a sequence of characters.
   - `Array`: Used to store multiple values of the same type.
   - `Class`: Used to create objects and define their behavior.

Here are some examples of using these data types in Java:

```java
int age = 25;
double pi = 3.14;
boolean isStudent = true;
char grade = 'A';

String name = "John Doe";
int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
MyClass obj = new MyClass();
```

Remember to choose the appropriate data type based on the type of data you want to store. Using the correct data type ensures efficient memory usage and prevents data type errors.
