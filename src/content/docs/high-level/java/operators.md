# Operators

In Java, operators are symbols that perform specific operations on one or more operands. Here are some commonly used operators in Java:

1. Arithmetic Operators:
   - Addition: `+`
   - Subtraction: `-`
   - Multiplication: `*`
   - Division: `/`
   - Modulus: `%`

2. Assignment Operators:
   - Simple Assignment: `=`
   - Addition Assignment: `+=`
   - Subtraction Assignment: `-=`
   - Multiplication Assignment: `*=`
   - Division Assignment: `/=`
   - Modulus Assignment: `%=`

3. Comparison Operators:
   - Equal to: `==`
   - Not equal to: `!=`
   - Greater than: `>`
   - Less than: `<`
   - Greater than or equal to: `>=`
   - Less than or equal to: `<=`

4. Logical Operators:
   - Logical AND: `&&`
   - Logical OR: `||`
   - Logical NOT: `!`

5. Bitwise Operators:
   - Bitwise AND: `&`
   - Bitwise OR: `|`
   - Bitwise XOR: `^`
   - Bitwise NOT: `~`
   - Left Shift: `<<`
   - Right Shift: `>>`
   - Unsigned Right Shift: `>>>`

These are just a few examples of operators in Java. Operators are an essential part of any programming language and understanding them is crucial for writing effective code.
