## Java Variables

In Java, variables are used to store data values. They are like containers that hold different types of information. 

### Declaring Variables

To declare a variable in Java, you need to specify the data type followed by the variable name. Here are some examples:

```java
int age;
double salary;
String name;
```

### Initializing Variables

After declaring a variable, you can assign a value to it. This is called initializing the variable. Here are some examples:

```java
int age = 25;
double salary = 50000.50;
String name = "John Doe";
```

### Using Variables

Once a variable is declared and initialized, you can use it in your code. Here's an example:

```java
int x = 10;
int y = 5;
int sum = x + y;
System.out.println("The sum of x and y is: " + sum);
```

In the above example, we declare three variables `x`, `y`, and `sum`. We assign values to `x` and `y`, and then calculate the sum of `x` and `y` and store it in the `sum` variable. Finally, we print the result using the `System.out.println()` method.

Remember, in Java, variables are case-sensitive, so `age` and `Age` are considered different variables.

That's it! You now know the basics of working with variables in Java.
