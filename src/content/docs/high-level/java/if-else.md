## If-Else in Java

In Java, the `if-else` statement is used to make decisions based on certain conditions. It allows the program to execute different blocks of code depending on whether a condition is true or false.

Here's the basic syntax of the `if-else` statement in Java:

```java
if (condition) {
    // code to be executed if the condition is true
} else {
    // code to be executed if the condition is false
}
```

Here's an example that demonstrates the usage of `if-else` in Java:

```java
int number = 10;

if (number > 0) {
    System.out.println("The number is positive.");
} else {
    System.out.println("The number is non-positive.");
}
```

In this example, if the `number` variable is greater than 0, the program will print "The number is positive." Otherwise, it will print "The number is non-positive."

You can also use multiple `else if` statements to handle multiple conditions. Here's an example:

```java
int number = 0;

if (number > 0) {
    System.out.println("The number is positive.");
} else if (number < 0) {
    System.out.println("The number is negative.");
} else {
    System.out.println("The number is zero.");
}
```

In this example, if the `number` variable is greater than 0, it will print "The number is positive." If the `number` variable is less than 0, it will print "The number is negative." Otherwise, it will print "The number is zero."

That's the basic usage of the `if-else` statement in Java. It allows you to control the flow of your program based on different conditions.
