In Java, class members are the variables and methods defined within a class. They can be accessed and used by objects of the class.

## Variables

Variables in a class are used to store data. They can be of different types such as int, double, String, etc. Here's an example of declaring and initializing a variable in Java:

```java
public class MyClass {
    int myVariable = 10;
}
```

## Methods

Methods in a class are used to perform specific actions. They can have parameters and return values. Here's an example of a method in Java:

```java
public class MyClass {
    public void printMessage(String message) {
        System.out.println(message);
    }
}
```

In the above example, the `printMessage` method takes a `String` parameter called `message` and prints it to the console.

Class members are accessed using the dot operator (`.`) with an object of the class. For example:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyClass myObject = new MyClass();
        System.out.println(myObject.myVariable); // Output: 10
        myObject.printMessage("Hello, world!"); // Output: Hello, world!
    }
}
```

In the above example, we create an object of the `MyClass` class and access its `myVariable` and `printMessage` methods.

That's it! You now have a basic understanding of class members in Java.
