Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming languages like Java. It allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class, known as the superclass or parent class.

To demonstrate inheritance in Java, consider the following example:

```java
public class Animal {
    protected String name;
    
    public Animal(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
    
    public void eat() {
        System.out.println(name + " is eating.");
    }
}

public class Dog extends Animal {
    public Dog(String name) {
        super(name);
    }
    
    public void bark() {
        System.out.println(name + " is barking.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog dog = new Dog("Buddy");
        dog.eat(); // Output: Buddy is eating.
        dog.bark(); // Output: Buddy is barking.
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Animal` class is the superclass, and the `Dog` class is the subclass. The `Dog` class inherits the `name` property and the `eat()` method from the `Animal` class. It also adds its own method, `bark()`. 

When we create an instance of the `Dog` class, we can access both the inherited method `eat()` and the subclass-specific method `bark()`.

This is just a basic example of inheritance in Java. In real-world scenarios, inheritance allows for code reuse, promotes modularity, and enables polymorphism.

Remember, in Java, a class can only inherit from one superclass, but it can implement multiple interfaces.
