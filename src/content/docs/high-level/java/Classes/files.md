# Files

In Java, the `java.io.File` class is used to represent files and directories. It provides methods for creating, deleting, and manipulating files.

## Creating a File

To create a new file, you can use the `createNewFile()` method. Here's an example:

```java
import java.io.File;
import java.io.IOException;

public class CreateFileExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            File file = new File("path/to/file.txt");
            if (file.createNewFile()) {
                System.out.println("File created successfully!");
            } else {
                System.out.println("File already exists.");
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("An error occurred.");
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

## Deleting a File

To delete a file, you can use the `delete()` method. Here's an example:

```java
import java.io.File;

public class DeleteFileExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        File file = new File("path/to/file.txt");
        if (file.delete()) {
            System.out.println("File deleted successfully!");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Failed to delete the file.");
        }
    }
}
```

These are just a few examples of how to work with files in Java. You can explore more methods and functionalities provided by the `java.io.File` class in the Java documentation.

Remember to handle exceptions properly when working with files to ensure your code is robust and error-free.
