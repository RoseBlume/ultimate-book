# Object Oriented Programming

Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code into objects, which are instances of classes. Java is a popular programming language that fully supports OOP concepts.

## Classes

In Java, a class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the properties and behaviors that objects of that class will have. Here's an example of a simple class in Java:

```java
public class Person {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    public Person(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    public void sayHello() {
        System.out.println("Hello, my name is " + name + " and I am " + age + " years old.");
    }
}
```

In the above example, we have a `Person` class with two private fields `name` and `age`. We also have a constructor that takes in the `name` and `age` as parameters and initializes the fields. The `sayHello` method prints a greeting message with the person's name and age.

## Objects

Once we have defined a class, we can create objects of that class. Here's how we can create a `Person` object and call its `sayHello` method:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Person person = new Person("John", 25);
        person.sayHello();
    }
}
```

In the above example, we create a `Person` object named `person` with the name "John" and age 25. We then call the `sayHello` method on the `person` object, which prints the greeting message.

## Inheritance

One of the key features of OOP is inheritance, which allows classes to inherit properties and behaviors from other classes. In Java, we can use the `extends` keyword to create a subclass that inherits from a superclass. Here's an example:

```java
public class Student extends Person {
    private String major;

    public Student(String name, int age, String major) {
        super(name, age);
        this.major = major;
    }

    public void study() {
        System.out.println(name + " is studying " + major);
    }
}
```

In the above example, we have a `Student` class that extends the `Person` class. It adds a new field `major` and a `study` method. The `super` keyword is used to call the superclass constructor.

## Conclusion

This is just a brief introduction to Object Oriented Programming in Java. There are many more concepts and features to explore. OOP provides a powerful way to organize and structure code, making it easier to understand and maintain.
