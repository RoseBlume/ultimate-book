Access modifiers in Java are keywords that determine the accessibility of classes, methods, and variables. There are four types of access modifiers in Java:

1. **Public**: Public access modifier allows classes, methods, and variables to be accessed from anywhere, both within and outside the package. For example:

```java
public class MyClass {
    public int myVariable;
    
    public void myMethod() {
        // code here
    }
}
```

2. **Private**: Private access modifier restricts the access to only within the same class. It is commonly used to encapsulate data and prevent direct access from outside the class. For example:

```java
public class MyClass {
    private int myVariable;
    
    private void myMethod() {
        // code here
    }
}
```

3. **Protected**: Protected access modifier allows access within the same package and subclasses in different packages. For example:

```java
public class MyClass {
    protected int myVariable;
    
    protected void myMethod() {
        // code here
    }
}
```

4. **Default (no modifier)**: Default access modifier allows access within the same package only. It is used when no access modifier is specified. For example:

```java
class MyClass {
    int myVariable;
    
    void myMethod() {
        // code here
    }
}
```

It is important to choose the appropriate access modifier based on the desired level of accessibility and encapsulation in your Java code.
