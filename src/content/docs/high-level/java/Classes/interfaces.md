In Java, an interface is a collection of abstract methods. It defines a contract that a class must adhere to if it implements the interface. 

Here's an example of an interface declaration:

```java
public interface Drawable {
    void draw();
}
```

To implement an interface, a class must use the `implements` keyword and provide an implementation for all the methods defined in the interface. 

```java
public class Circle implements Drawable {
    public void draw() {
        // implementation goes here
    }
}
```

# Multiple Interfaces

A class in Java can implement multiple interfaces. This allows the class to inherit the abstract methods from all the interfaces it implements. 

Here's an example of a class implementing multiple interfaces:

```java
public interface Playable {
    void play();
}

public class MusicPlayer implements Drawable, Playable {
    public void draw() {
        // implementation goes here
    }
    
    public void play() {
        // implementation goes here
    }
}
```

By implementing multiple interfaces, a class can exhibit behavior from different aspects of the application.
