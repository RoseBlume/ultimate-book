## Break Statement

The `break` statement is used to terminate the execution of a loop or a switch statement. When the `break` statement is encountered, the control flow immediately exits the loop or switch statement.

Here is an example of using the `break` statement in a `for` loop:

```java
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i == 5) {
    break;
  }
  System.out.println(i);
}
```

In this example, the loop will terminate when `i` becomes equal to 5. The output will be:

```
0
1
2
3
4
```

## Continue Statement

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop and move to the next iteration. It is commonly used to skip certain iterations based on a condition.

Here is an example of using the `continue` statement in a `while` loop:

```java
int i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
  i++;
  if (i == 3) {
    continue;
  }
  System.out.println(i);
}
```

In this example, the loop will skip the iteration when `i` is equal to 3. The output will be:

```
1
2
4
5
```

Remember to use the `break` and `continue` statements judiciously to control the flow of your loops in Java.
