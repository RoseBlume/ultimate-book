title: Tables
description: A guide in my new Starlight docs site.

Guides lead a user through a specific task they want to accomplish, often with a sequence of steps.
Writing a good guide requires thinking about what your users are trying to do.

### Table Elements
- The `<table>` tag represents the table element and contains all other table Elements
- The `<th>` tag represents the table header element
- The `<tr>` tag represents the table row element and typically contains the table header and table data elements
- The `<td>` tag represents the table data element

### Table Borders

### Code
```html
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Student</th>
    <th>Score</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Maria</td>
    <td>8</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Jeff</td>
    <td>4</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Kaden</td>
    <td>10</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```
