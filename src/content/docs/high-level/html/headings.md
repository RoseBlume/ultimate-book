description: A guide in my new Starlight docs site.

In HTML a heading is written as `<h1>` or `<h2>`. For example, `<h1>` would be the largest heading and `<h2>` would be smaller than `<h1>`.
### Code
```html
<html>
<h1>This is an h1 heading</h1>
<h2>This is an h2 heading</h2>
<h3>This is an h3 heading</h3>
<h4>This is an h4 heading</h4>
<h5>This is an h5 heading</h5>
<h6>This is an h6 heading</h6>
</html>
```
