## Block and Inline Elements in HTML
Block and inline elements are fundamental concepts in HTML. Understanding the difference between them is crucial for creating well-structured web pages.

### Block Level Elements
Block level elements are those that take up the full width available and start on a new line. They are used to structure the layout of a web page. Examples of block level elements include `<div>`, `<p>`, `<h1>` to `<h6>`, `<ul>`, `<ol>`, and `<li>`. Block level elements can contain other block level and inline elements.

### Inline Level Elements
Inline level elements, on the other hand, do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary. They are used to style and format text within a block level element. Examples of inline level elements include `<span>`, `<a>`, `<strong>`, `<em>`, `<img>`, and `<input>`. Inline level elements cannot contain block level elements but can contain other inline elements.

Understanding the distinction between block and inline elements is important for controlling the layout and formatting of your web pages. By using the appropriate elements in the right context, you can create well-structured and visually appealing websites.
