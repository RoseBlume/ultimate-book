Favicons are small icons that are displayed in the browser tab or bookmark bar to represent a website. They help users easily identify and distinguish between different websites.

To add a favicon to your website, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a favicon image: Start by creating a square image (usually 16x16 pixels or 32x32 pixels) that represents your website's brand or logo. Save the image in a common image format such as PNG or ICO.

2. Place the favicon image in the root directory of your website: Upload the favicon image to the root directory of your website. This is typically the same directory where your index.html file is located.

3. Add the favicon link tag to your HTML: Open your HTML file and locate the `<head>` section. Insert the following line of code between the `<head>` and `</head>` tags:

    ```html
    <link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon">
    ```

    Make sure to replace `favicon.ico` with the actual filename of your favicon image.

4. Test the favicon: Save your HTML file and open it in a web browser. You should now see your favicon displayed in the browser tab or bookmark bar.

Remember to replace `favicon.ico` in the code snippet with the actual filename of your favicon image.

That's it! You have successfully added a favicon to your website. It's a small but important detail that can enhance the overall user experience.
