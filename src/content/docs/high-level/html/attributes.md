Attributes in HTML provide additional information about an element. They are used to modify the behavior or appearance of an HTML element.

Here are a few examples of commonly used attributes in HTML:

1. `class`: The `class` attribute is used to specify one or more class names for an element. It is often used to style multiple elements with the same class.

2. `id`: The `id` attribute is used to uniquely identify an element. It is often used to target specific elements with CSS or JavaScript.

3. `src`: The `src` attribute is used to specify the source URL of an external resource, such as an image or a script.

4. `href`: The `href` attribute is used to specify the destination URL of a hyperlink. It is commonly used in `<a>` tags.

5. `alt`: The `alt` attribute is used to provide alternative text for an image. It is displayed if the image fails to load or for accessibility purposes.

These are just a few examples, and there are many more attributes available in HTML. Each element has its own set of attributes that can be used to customize its behavior and appearance.

Remember to always refer to the official HTML documentation for a comprehensive list of attributes and their usage.
