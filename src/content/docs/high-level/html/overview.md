HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language for creating web pages and applications. It provides the structure and content of a webpage, defining the elements and their relationships. HTML uses tags to mark up different parts of the content, such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more.

With HTML, you can create the basic structure of a webpage, organize and format text, add images and multimedia, create hyperlinks to navigate between pages, and embed scripts for interactivity. It allows you to structure and present information in a meaningful way, making it accessible to both humans and web browsers.

HTML is the backbone of the web and is supported by all modern browsers. It plays a crucial role in web development, serving as the foundation for building websites, web applications, and other online content.
