To format text in HTML, you can use various elements. Here are some commonly used ones:

1. `<em>`: The `<em>` element is used to emphasize text. It typically renders as italicized text. For example:
    ```html
    <p>This is <em>emphasized</em> text.</p>
    ```

2. `<i>`: The `<i>` element is used to indicate text that is in an alternate voice or mood. It also renders as italicized text. For example:
    ```html
    <p>This is <i>italicized</i> text.</p>
    ```

3. `<small>`: The `<small>` element is used to render text in a smaller font size. For example:
    ```html
    <p>This is <small>smaller</small> text.</p>
    ```

4. `<mark>`: The `<mark>` element is used to highlight or mark a specific portion of text. It typically renders with a yellow background. For example:
    ```html
    <p>This is <mark>highlighted</mark> text.</p>
    ```

5. `<del>`: The `<del>` element is used to indicate deleted or removed text. It typically renders with a strikethrough effect. For example:
    ```html
    <p>This is <del>deleted</del> text.</p>
    ```

6. `<strong>` or `<bold>`: The `<strong>` element (or `<bold>` for backward compatibility) is used to indicate strong importance. It typically renders as bold text. For example:
    ```html
    <p>This is <strong>strong</strong> text.</p>
    ```

7. `<ins>`: The `<ins>` element is used to indicate inserted or added text. It typically renders with an underline effect. For example:
    ```html
    <p>This is <ins>inserted</ins> text.</p>
    ```

8. `<sub>`: The `<sub>` element is used to render text as subscript, which is positioned below the normal text line. For example:
    ```html
    <p>This is <sub>subscript</sub> text.</p>
    ```

9. `<sup>`: The `<sup>` element is used to render text as superscript, which is positioned above the normal text line. For example:
    ```html
    <p>This is <sup>superscript</sup> text.</p>
    ```

Remember to always use these elements semantically, based on their intended meaning, rather than just for visual styling.
