Images have the `<image>` tag. Unlike most other elements it is best to use a single tag. This is because text cannot be displayed within this element. In order to display an image you must link to one. This can be done using an absolute or relative link.

### Code
```html
<h1> This is a relative link to an image located within the same directory as the html file. </h1>
<img src="America.jpg" />
<h1>This is an absolute link to an online image</h1>
<img src="https://cdn.britannica.com/68/7068-004-7848FEB4/Flag-Canada.jpg" />
```
