Iframes in HTML allow you to embed another web page within your current page. This is useful when you want to display content from another source, such as a video, map, or social media feed.

To add an iframe, use the `<iframe>` tag and specify the source URL using the `src` attribute. Here's an example:

```html
<iframe src="https://www.example.com"></iframe>
```

You can also customize the appearance and behavior of the iframe using various attributes. For example, you can set the width and height using the `width` and `height` attributes, respectively:

```html
<iframe src="https://www.example.com" width="500" height="300"></iframe>
```

Additionally, you can specify whether the iframe should have a border, scrolling, or allow fullscreen mode using the `frameborder`, `scrolling`, and `allowfullscreen` attributes, respectively.

Remember to ensure that the source URL is secure and trustworthy to prevent any security risks.
