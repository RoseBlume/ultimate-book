## Elements in HTML

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language for creating web pages. It consists of various elements that define the structure and content of a web page.

Here are some commonly used HTML elements:

- `<h1>` to `<h6>`: Headings of different levels, with `<h1>` being the highest level and `<h6>` being the lowest.
- `<p>`: Paragraphs of text.
- `<a>`: Hyperlinks, used to link to other web pages or resources.
- `<img>`: Images, used to display images on a web page.
- `<ul>` and `<ol>`: Unordered and ordered lists, respectively.
- `<li>`: List items, used within `<ul>` or `<ol>` to define individual list items.
- `<div>`: A generic container element used to group other elements.
- `<span>`: An inline container element used to apply styles or manipulate text within a larger block of content.
- `<table>`: A table element used to display tabular data.
- `<form>`: A form element used to create interactive input fields and submit data to a server.

These are just a few examples of HTML elements. There are many more elements available in HTML, each serving a specific purpose. By combining and nesting these elements, you can create complex and interactive web pages.

Remember to always close HTML elements properly by using the closing tag (`</tagname>`), unless the element is self-closing (e.g., `<img>`).

For more detailed information about HTML elements and their attributes, you can refer to the official HTML documentation or various online resources.
