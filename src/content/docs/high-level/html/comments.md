Comments in HTML are used to add explanatory notes or reminders within the code that are not displayed on the webpage. They are useful for documenting your code or temporarily disabling certain sections. 

To add a comment in HTML, you can use the `<!-- -->` syntax. Anything placed between these opening and closing comment tags will be ignored by the browser when rendering the webpage.

Here's an example:

```html
<!-- This is a comment -->
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
```

In the above example, the comment `This is a comment` will not be displayed on the webpage, but the paragraph element `<p>This is a paragraph.</p>` will be rendered.

Comments can also span multiple lines:

```html
<!--
This is a multi-line
comment.
-->
<p>This is another paragraph.</p>
```

In this case, the entire block of text between the opening `<!--` and closing `-->` tags will be treated as a comment.

Remember that comments are not visible to users visiting your webpage, but they can be helpful for other developers who are reading or maintaining your code.
