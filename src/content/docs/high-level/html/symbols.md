Entities in HTML are special characters that have reserved meanings. They are represented using entity references, which start with an ampersand (&) and end with a semicolon (;).

Here are a few commonly used entities in HTML:

- `&lt;` represents the less-than symbol (<).
- `&gt;` represents the greater-than symbol (>).
- `&amp;` represents the ampersand symbol (&).
- `&quot;` represents the double quotation mark (").
- `&apos;` represents the single quotation mark (').

You can use these entities to display special characters in your HTML documents without them being interpreted as markup.

For example, if you want to display the less-than symbol (<) in your HTML, you can use the entity reference `&lt;` like this: `&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;`.

Remember to always end entity references with a semicolon (;) to ensure proper rendering in all browsers.
