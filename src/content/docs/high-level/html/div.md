A `<div>` element in HTML is a container that is used to group other HTML elements together. It is a block-level element that is commonly used for layout purposes.

You can use the `<div>` element to create sections or divisions within your HTML document. By applying CSS styles to the `<div>` element, you can control its appearance and position on the page.

Here's an example of how you can use the `<div>` element in HTML:

```html
<div>
    <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph inside a div.</p>
    <button>Click me</button>
</div>
```

In the example above, the `<div>` element is used to group the heading, paragraph, and button elements together. This allows you to apply styles or manipulate them as a group.

Remember to close the `<div>` element using the closing tag `</div>`. You can also give the `<div>` element an optional `class` or `id` attribute to target it with CSS or JavaScript.
