Numbers in NASM Assembly
=======================

In NASM assembly, numbers can be represented in various formats, such as decimal, hexadecimal, and binary. Here are some examples:

Decimal Numbers
---------------
To represent decimal numbers, simply write the number as it is. For example:

```assembly
mov eax, 42
```

Hexadecimal Numbers
-------------------
To represent hexadecimal numbers, prefix the number with `0x`. For example:

```assembly
mov ebx, 0x2A
```

Binary Numbers
--------------
To represent binary numbers, prefix the number with `0b`. For example:

```assembly
mov ecx, 0b101010
```

You can perform arithmetic operations on these numbers using NASM assembly instructions.
