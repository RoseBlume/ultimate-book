Memory Segments in NASM Assembly:

In NASM assembly, memory segments are used to organize and access different areas of memory. Each segment represents a specific region of memory with its own characteristics and usage.

Here are some commonly used memory segments in NASM assembly:

1. Code Segment (CS): This segment holds the executable instructions of the program. It is used to store the code that the CPU fetches and executes. Example:

```assembly
section .text
  global _start

_start:
  ; Code instructions go here
```

2. Data Segment (DS): This segment is used to store initialized data such as variables and constants. Example:

```assembly
section .data
  message db 'Hello, World!', 0

section .text
  global _start

_start:
  ; Access data segment
  mov eax, message
  ; Code instructions go here
```

3. Stack Segment (SS): This segment is used to store the stack, which is used for function calls, local variables, and other temporary data. Example:

```assembly
section .text
  global _start

_start:
  ; Set up stack segment
  mov ax, 0x07C0
  mov ss, ax
  mov sp, 0x1000

  ; Code instructions go here
```

4. Extra Segment (ES): This segment is used for additional data storage. It can be used to access data in other segments. Example:

```assembly
section .data
  message db 'Hello, World!', 0

section .text
  global _start

_start:
  ; Set up extra segment
  mov ax, 0x0000
  mov es, ax

  ; Access data in extra segment
  mov di, message
  ; Code instructions go here
```

These are just a few examples of memory segments in NASM assembly. Understanding and utilizing memory segments correctly is crucial for efficient and organized programming.
