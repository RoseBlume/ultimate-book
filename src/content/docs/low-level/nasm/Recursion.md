Recursion in NASM Assembly:

Recursion is a powerful programming technique that allows a function to call itself. In NASM Assembly, recursion can be used to solve problems that can be divided into smaller subproblems.

To illustrate recursion in NASM Assembly, let's consider an example of calculating the factorial of a number. The factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted as n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.

Here's an example implementation of a recursive factorial function in NASM Assembly:

```assembly
section .data
  result db 0

section .text
global _start

_start:
  mov ecx, 5  ; calculate factorial of 5
  call factorial

  ; Print the result
  mov eax, 4
  mov ebx, 1
  mov edx, 1
  int 0x80

  ; Exit the program
  mov eax, 1
  xor ebx, ebx
  int 0x80

factorial:
  push ebp
  mov ebp, esp

  mov eax, [ebp + 8]  ; get the argument
  cmp eax, 1
  jle return_one

  dec eax
  push eax
  call factorial
  add esp, 4

  mov ebx, [ebp + 8]  ; get the argument
  imul eax, ebx

return_one:
  mov [result], eax

  mov esp, ebp
  pop ebp
  ret
```

In this example, the `factorial` function calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion. It first checks if the argument is less than or equal to 1. If so, it returns 1 as the base case. Otherwise, it decrements the argument, calls itself with the decremented argument, and multiplies the result with the original argument.

The program then calls the `factorial` function with an argument of 5 and prints the result.

Recursion can be a powerful tool in NASM Assembly programming, but it should be used with caution to avoid infinite loops or excessive stack usage.
