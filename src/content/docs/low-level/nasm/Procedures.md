## Procedures

In NASM assembly, procedures are used to encapsulate a block of code that can be called from multiple locations in a program. They provide a way to organize and reuse code, making assembly programming more modular.

To define a procedure, you can use the `PROC` directive followed by the procedure name. Here's an example:

```assembly
PROC myProcedure
  ; Procedure code goes here
  ret
ENDP
```

Within a procedure, you can include any valid assembly instructions. The `ret` instruction is used to return from the procedure.

To call a procedure, you can use the `CALL` instruction followed by the procedure name. Here's an example:

```assembly
CALL myProcedure
```

You can also pass arguments to a procedure by pushing them onto the stack before calling the procedure. The procedure can then access the arguments using the `ebp` register. Here's an example:

```assembly
PROC myProcedure
  push ebp
  mov ebp, esp

  ; Access arguments using ebp

  mov esp, ebp
  pop ebp
  ret
ENDP
```

Procedures can also have a return value. The return value is typically stored in a register, such as `eax`. Here's an example:

```assembly
PROC myProcedure
  ; Procedure code goes here

  mov eax, 42 ; Set return value to 42

  ret
ENDP
```

That's a basic overview of procedures in NASM assembly. They are a powerful tool for organizing and reusing code in assembly programs.
