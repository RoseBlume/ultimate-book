Memory management in NASM assembly involves allocating and deallocating memory resources for storing data during program execution. This is crucial for efficient and organized memory usage.

One way to allocate memory is by using the `section` directive. For example, to allocate a section of memory called "data" and initialize it with some values, you can use the following code:

```assembly
section .data
  myVariable db 10   ; Allocate 1 byte of memory and initialize it with value 10
  myArray    db 1, 2, 3, 4, 5   ; Allocate 5 bytes of memory and initialize them with values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
```

In this example, the `section .data` directive creates a section of memory called "data" where you can store initialized data.

To deallocate memory, you don't need to explicitly free the memory in NASM assembly. The memory is automatically deallocated when the program terminates.

Another important aspect of memory management is managing the stack. The stack is a region of memory used for storing local variables and function call information. NASM provides instructions like `push` and `pop` to manage the stack.

Here's an example that demonstrates stack usage:

```assembly
section .text
  global _start

_start:
  push ebp        ; Save the current base pointer
  mov ebp, esp    ; Set the base pointer to the current stack pointer

  sub esp, 4      ; Allocate 4 bytes of memory on the stack
  mov dword [ebp-4], 42   ; Store the value 42 in the allocated memory

  ; Perform some operations with the allocated memory

  add esp, 4      ; Deallocate the memory by adjusting the stack pointer
  pop ebp         ; Restore the previous base pointer

  mov eax, 1      ; Exit system call
  xor ebx, ebx    ; Exit status 0
  int 0x80        ; Invoke the system call
```

In this example, we allocate 4 bytes of memory on the stack using the `sub` instruction, store a value in it, perform some operations, and then deallocate the memory by adjusting the stack pointer with the `add` instruction.

Remember to always manage memory carefully to avoid memory leaks and unexpected behavior in your NASM assembly programs.
