Loops in NASM Assembly:

Loops are an essential part of programming, allowing us to repeat a block of code multiple times. In NASM Assembly, we can implement loops using conditional jumps.

Here's an example of a loop that prints the numbers 1 to 10:

```assembly
section .data
  msg db "Number: %d", 10, 0

section .text
  global _start

_start:
  mov ecx, 1  ; initialize counter

loop_start:
  push ecx  ; save counter value

  push msg  ; push format string
  push ecx  ; push counter value
  call printf  ; call printf function
  add esp, 8  ; clean up the stack

  pop ecx  ; restore counter value
  inc ecx  ; increment counter

  cmp ecx, 11  ; compare counter with 11
  jne loop_start  ; jump to loop_start if not equal

  mov eax, 1  ; exit system call
  xor ebx, ebx
  int 0x80
```

In this example, we use the `ecx` register as a counter to keep track of the current number. We start by initializing `ecx` to 1. Inside the loop, we push the counter value onto the stack, print it using the `printf` function, and then increment the counter. We compare the counter with 11 and if they are not equal, we jump back to the `loop_start` label to repeat the loop. Once the counter reaches 11, we exit the program.

Loops are a powerful tool in NASM Assembly that allow us to perform repetitive tasks efficiently. Experiment with different loop structures and conditions to achieve the desired functionality.
