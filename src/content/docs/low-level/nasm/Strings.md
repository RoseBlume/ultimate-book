## Strings in NASM Assembly

In NASM assembly, strings are sequences of characters stored in memory. They are typically terminated by a null character (`'\0'`). Here's an example of declaring and initializing a string:

```assembly
section .data
  myString db 'Hello, World!', 0

section .text
  global _start

_start:
  ; Print the string
  mov eax, 4
  mov ebx, 1
  mov ecx, myString
  mov edx, 13
  int 0x80

  ; Exit the program
  mov eax, 1
  xor ebx, ebx
  int 0x80
```

In the above example, we declare a string named `myString` in the `.data` section and initialize it with the value `'Hello, World!'`. The null character (`0`) is added at the end to terminate the string.

To print the string, we use the `write` system call. The file descriptor `1` represents standard output. We pass the address of the string (`myString`) in the `ecx` register and the length of the string (`13`) in the `edx` register.

Finally, we exit the program using the `exit` system call.

Remember to include the necessary NASM assembly directives and linker commands to compile and run the program.
