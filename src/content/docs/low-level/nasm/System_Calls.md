System calls in NASM assembly allow programs to interact with the operating system and perform various tasks such as file operations, input/output, and process management. Here are a few examples of system calls in NASM assembly:

1. Exit Program:
To terminate a program, you can use the `exit` system call. Here's an example:

```assembly
section .data
  message db 'Exiting program', 0  ; Define a message to be printed

section .text
  global _start

_start:
  ; Print message
  mov eax, 4  ; System call number for printing
  mov ebx, 1  ; File descriptor for standard output
  mov ecx, message  ; Address of the message
  mov edx, 14  ; Length of the message
  int 0x80  ; Call the system interrupt

  ; Exit program
  mov eax, 1  ; System call number for program termination
  xor ebx, ebx  ; Exit status
  int 0x80  ; Call the system interrupt
```

2. Read Input:
To read input from the user, you can use the `read` system call. Here's an example:

```assembly
section .data
  message db 'Enter a number: ', 0  ; Define a message to prompt for input
  buffer resb 16  ; Reserve space for input buffer

section .text
  global _start

_start:
  ; Print message
  mov eax, 4  ; System call number for printing
  mov ebx, 1  ; File descriptor for standard output
  mov ecx, message  ; Address of the message
  mov edx, 16  ; Length of the message
  int 0x80  ; Call the system interrupt

  ; Read input
  mov eax, 3  ; System call number for reading
  mov ebx, 0  ; File descriptor for standard input
  mov ecx, buffer  ; Address of the input buffer
  mov edx, 16  ; Maximum number of bytes to read
  int 0x80  ; Call the system interrupt

  ; Process input
  ; ...

  ; Exit program
  mov eax, 1  ; System call number for program termination
  xor ebx, ebx  ; Exit status
  int 0x80  ; Call the system interrupt
```

3. File Operations:
To perform file operations like opening, reading, writing, and closing files, you can use system calls such as `open`, `read`, `write`, and `close`. Here's an example of reading a file:

```assembly
section .data
  filename db 'input.txt', 0  ; Define the filename
  buffer resb 1024  ; Reserve space for file data

section .text
  global _start

_start:
  ; Open file
  mov eax, 5  ; System call number for opening a file
  mov ebx, filename  ; Address of the filename
  mov ecx, 0  ; File access mode
  mov edx, 0  ; File permissions
  int 0x80  ; Call the system interrupt

  ; Read file
  mov eax, 3  ; System call number for reading
  mov ebx, eax  ; File descriptor
  mov ecx, buffer  ; Address of the buffer
  mov edx, 1024  ; Maximum number of bytes to read
  int 0x80  ; Call the system interrupt

  ; Process file data
  ; ...

  ; Close file
  mov eax, 6  ; System call number for closing a file
  mov ebx, eax  ; File descriptor
  int 0x80  ; Call the system interrupt

  ; Exit program
  mov eax, 1  ; System call number for program termination
  xor ebx, ebx  ; Exit status
  int 0x80  ; Call the system interrupt
```

These are just a few examples of system calls in NASM assembly. System calls provide a powerful way to interact with the operating system and extend the functionality of your assembly programs.
