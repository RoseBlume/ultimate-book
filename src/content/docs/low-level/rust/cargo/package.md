title: Creating A New Package
description: A guide in my new Starlight docs site.

To create a new package with Cargo, you can use the following command:

```bash
cargo new my-package
```

This will create a new directory called "my-package" with the basic structure for a Rust package. You can replace "my-package" with the desired name for your package.

Once the package is created, you can navigate into the directory using:

```bash
cd my-package
```

Inside the package directory, you will find a "src" directory where you can place your Rust source code files. By convention, the entry point of your package is usually a file called "main.rs" located in the "src" directory.

To build and run your package, you can use the following command:

```bash
cargo run
```

This will compile and execute your package. If your package has a "main.rs" file, it will be executed as the entry point.

You can also build your package without running it using:

```bash
cargo build
```

This will compile your package and generate the executable file in the "target/debug" directory.

To include dependencies in your package, you can specify them in the "Cargo.toml" file. For example, to include the "rand" crate, you can add the following line under the "[dependencies]" section:

```toml
rand = "0.8.4"
```

After adding the dependency, you can use it in your code by adding an import statement at the top of your source code file.

That's it! You have now created a new package with Cargo and learned how to build, run, and include dependencies in it.
