Comments in Rust are used to add explanatory or descriptive text within your code. They are ignored by the compiler and have no impact on the execution of the program.

There are two types of comments in Rust: single-line comments and multi-line comments.

Single-line comments start with `//` and continue until the end of the line. They are commonly used for short explanations or clarifications. Here's an example:

```rust
// This is a single-line comment
let x = 5; // Assigning the value 5 to variable x
```

Multi-line comments start with `/*` and end with `*/`. They can span multiple lines and are useful for longer explanations or commenting out blocks of code. Here's an example:

```rust
/*
This is a multi-line comment.
It can span multiple lines.
*/

/*
fn some_function() {
    // This code is commented out
    // It won't be executed
}
*/
```

Remember to use comments to make your code more readable and understandable for yourself and others who may read your code.
