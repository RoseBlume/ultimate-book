Structs in Rust are a way to define custom data types that can hold multiple values of different types. They are similar to structs in other programming languages like C or C++. 

Here's an example of how to define a struct in Rust:

```rust
struct Person {
    name: String,
    age: u32,
    is_student: bool,
}
```

In the above example, we define a struct called `Person` with three fields: `name` of type `String`, `age` of type `u32` (unsigned 32-bit integer), and `is_student` of type `bool`.

You can create an instance of the `Person` struct and access its fields like this:

```rust
let person = Person {
    name: String::from("John Doe"),
    age: 25,
    is_student: true,
};

println!("Name: {}", person.name);
println!("Age: {}", person.age);
println!("Is Student: {}", person.is_student);
```

Structs can also have methods associated with them using the `impl` keyword. Here's an example:

```rust
impl Person {
    fn introduce(&self) {
        println!("Hi, my name is {} and I'm {} years old.", self.name, self.age);
    }
}

let person = Person {
    name: String::from("John Doe"),
    age: 25,
    is_student: true,
};

person.introduce();
```

In the above example, we define an `impl` block for the `Person` struct and define a method called `introduce` that takes a reference to `self` (the instance of the struct) and prints a message introducing the person.

Structs in Rust are a powerful way to organize and manipulate data. They provide a flexible and efficient way to define custom data types with their own fields and methods.
