title: The Slice Type
description: A guide in my new Starlight docs site.

The slice type in Rust allows you to reference a contiguous sequence of elements in a collection. It is represented by the `&[T]` type, where `T` is the type of the elements in the slice.

Slices are commonly used to work with arrays, vectors, and other collections. They provide a flexible and efficient way to access and manipulate subsets of data without needing to copy the entire collection.

Here are a few examples of using slices in Rust:

1. Creating a slice from an array:
```rust
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let slice = &numbers[1..4]; // creates a slice containing elements 2, 3, and 4
```

2. Passing a slice as a function parameter:
```rust
fn sum(numbers: &[i32]) -> i32 {
    let mut total = 0;
    for &num in numbers {
        total += num;
    }
    total
}

let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let result = sum(&numbers); // pass a slice of the array to the function
```

3. Modifying a slice:
```rust
let mut numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let slice = &mut numbers[1..4]; // creates a mutable slice
slice[0] = 10; // modifies the second element of the slice

assert_eq!(numbers, [1, 10, 3, 4, 5]); // original array is modified
```

Slices provide a convenient way to work with subsets of data in Rust, allowing you to avoid unnecessary copying and improve performance.
