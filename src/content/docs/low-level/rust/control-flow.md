Control flow in Rust allows you to dictate the order in which statements and expressions are executed. It includes conditional statements, loops, and branching.

Conditional statements:
Rust provides the `if`, `else if`, and `else` keywords for conditional execution. Here's an example:

```rust
let number = 7;

if number < 5 {
    println!("Number is less than 5");
} else if number == 5 {
    println!("Number is equal to 5");
} else {
    println!("Number is greater than 5");
}
```

Loops:
Rust offers different types of loops, such as `loop`, `while`, and `for`. Here's an example of a `for` loop:

```rust
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

for number in numbers.iter() {
    println!("Number: {}", number);
}
```

Branching:
Rust provides the `match` keyword for pattern matching and branching. Here's an example:

```rust
let fruit = "apple";

match fruit {
    "apple" => println!("It's an apple"),
    "banana" => println!("It's a banana"),
    _ => println!("It's something else"),
}
```

These are just a few examples of control flow in Rust. You can explore more advanced concepts like `if let` and `while let` for more specific scenarios.
