Functions in Rust allow you to encapsulate a block of code that can be reused and called multiple times. They are defined using the `fn` keyword followed by the function name, optional parameters, and a return type.

Here's an example of a simple function in Rust:

```rust
fn greet(name: &str) {
    println!("Hello, {}!", name);
}
```

In this example, the `greet` function takes a parameter `name` of type `&str` (a string slice) and prints a greeting message using the `println!` macro.

You can call the `greet` function like this:

```rust
greet("Alice");
```

This will output:

```
Hello, Alice!
```

Functions can also have a return type. Here's an example of a function that calculates the sum of two numbers and returns the result:

```rust
fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a + b
}
```

In this example, the `add` function takes two parameters `a` and `b` of type `i32` (32-bit signed integer) and returns the sum of `a` and `b`.

You can call the `add` function and store the result in a variable like this:

```rust
let result = add(3, 5);
println!("The sum is: {}", result);
```

This will output:

```
The sum is: 8
```

Functions in Rust can also have default parameter values, variable-length arguments, and closures. You can explore these advanced topics in the Rust documentation.

Remember to always define your functions before calling them in your code.
